# i2pr-irc Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for active planning. Detailed requirements and completed evidence live in the canonical documents, subsystem roadmaps, implementation plans, closure records, research records, and Git history.

Canonical direction:

- plans/000-long-term-specification.md
- plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md
- plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md
- plans/003-planning-process.md

## Status vocabulary

- proposed — roadmap or plan exists but is not approved/dependency-ready for execution.
- ready — dependencies/interfaces are satisfied and the plan may be handed off.
- active — implementation or closure work is in progress.
- blocked — a named hard/interface dependency prevents implementation.
- research-blocked — no implementation is justified until a named research/product condition exists.
- closing — implementation landed and closure evidence is being gathered.
- closed — closure record accepted.
- conditionally closed — production work landed but a named evidence condition remains.
- superseded — replaced by another planning artifact.
- archived — retained only for traceability.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies or blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bouncer core | active prerequisite corrective | plans/subsystems/bouncer-core-roadmap.md | Corrective 014 ready | M004 is fully decomposed in Plans 015-018, but UF-013-1 must close under Corrective 014 first. After 014, M004-A and M004-B may proceed in parallel. |
| I2P router integration | proposed / blocked | plans/subsystems/i2p-router-integration-roadmap.md | R001 blocked | Canonical ordering requires bouncer-core M005 before portable SAM implementation. R002 additionally waits on stable public i2pr app I2P-stream/local-listener/lifecycle contracts. R003 requires a concrete product need plus stable scoped control semantics. |

## Unplanned later milestones

M004 is now fully decomposed and registered. Only later roadmap milestones remain intentionally unplanned.

- Bouncer Core M005 — mature operator feature set;
- Router R001 — portable SAM adapter/cross-router qualification;
- Router R002 — i2pr managed-app adapter;
- Router R003 — optional scoped Proposal 170/control integration.

Do not create implementation code for these merely from their roadmap descriptions. Research may continue, but implementation handoffs must be written/refreshed against the then-current repository state and dependency closures.

## Accepted architecture decisions

| ADR | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| plans/adrs/ADR-0001-i2p-only-upstream-and-router-adapter-boundary.md | accepted | Upstream IRC authority is structurally I2P-only through I2pStreamProvider; SAM/i2pr are adapters; Proposal 170 is separate optional control plane. |
| plans/adrs/ADR-0002-bounded-sqlite-persistence-history-order-and-session-identity.md | accepted | M003 uses an owned bounded rusqlite worker; durable DesiredState/history/cursors remain separate from live ObservedState; HistoryEventId is canonical order; SessionId is ephemeral and distinct from durable ClientId. |

## Research authority

Current foundation research:

- plans/research/001-bouncer-and-i2p-foundation.md
- plans/research/004-m003-storage-multiclient-history-research.md
- plans/research/005-m004-anonymity-and-adverse-network-research.md

Important retained conclusions:

- ZNC is a feature-envelope reference, not the target extension architecture.
- soju's persistent multi-network/multi-client/history model is the closer conceptual bouncer reference; implementation remains independent.
- IRCv3 labeled-response is foundational to later multi-client request routing.
- draft/chathistory and draft/read-marker remain draft-isolated wire adapters over internal durable history/cursor semantics.
- SAM 3.1 STREAM is the conservative first portable router target and should use long-lived session ownership.
- Proposal 170 is not required for the IRC data path.
- i2pr managed-app integration waits for public app-scoped I2P stream and local accepted-stream/listener capabilities; it must not import private router internals.

## Immediate handoff

Implement only:

- `plans/implementation/bouncer-core/014-live-multiclient-response-routing-corrective.md`

Corrective 014 owns UF-013-1 and makes the existing ResponseRouter live on the real client/upstream path. It must prove labeled-response translation and bounded WHOIS/WHO/NAMES/LIST fallback deliver replies only to the requesting SessionId.

After Corrective 014 closes, Plans 015 and 016 may proceed independently/in parallel:

- `plans/implementation/bouncer-core/015-m004a-anonymity-protocol-mediation.md`
- `plans/implementation/bouncer-core/016-m004b-global-reconnect-budget.md`

Plan 017 waits on both, and Plan 018 is the integrated M004 qualification/closure pass.

M005 remains sequenced behind full M004 closure, and router integration remains blocked behind M005.
